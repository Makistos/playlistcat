2. **Auto-fetch**: The playlist loads automatically
3. **Manual entry**: You can still enter playlist IDs manually

## Authentication Details

### What Gets Stored
- Authentication headers (cookies, tokens)
- Stored locally in `~/.playlistcat_auth.json`
- **Encrypted storage recommended for production use**

### Session Management
- **Automatic**: Login persists between app sessions
- **Manual logout**: Click "Logout" to clear credentials
- **Auto-cleanup**: Invalid credentials are automatically removed

### Security Notes
- Authentication data is stored locally
- No passwords are ever stored
- Only session cookies and tokens are saved
- Data is tied to your specific browser session

## Troubleshooting

### "Login Failed" or "Could not parse authentication data"
- **Check cURL command format**: Ensure you copied the complete command
- **Try different request**: Use a different network request from the browser
- **Look for /youtubei/v1/ requests**: These often have better authentication headers
- **Verify cookies**: Make sure the request includes Cookie headers with SID, HSID, SSID, APISID, SAPISID

### "No playlists found"
- **Check account**: Ensure you have playlists in your YouTube Music account
- **Refresh**: Click "Refresh Playlists" to reload
- **Logout/Login**: Try logging out and logging in again

### "Authentication expired"
- **Re-authenticate**: Your session may have expired
- **Clear and retry**: Logout and setup authentication again

### Common cURL Issues
- **Multi-line commands**: Commands with backslashes (\\) for line continuation are supported
- **Missing cookies**: Make sure the cURL includes a Cookie header
- **Browser differences**: Different browsers format cURL differently - all are supported
- **Incomplete copy**: Ensure you copied the entire cURL command including all headers

### cURL Command Examples
**Good cURL (includes authentication cookies):**
```bash
curl 'https://music.youtube.com/youtubei/v1/browse' \
  -H 'Cookie: SID=...; HSID=...; SSID=...; APISID=...; SAPISID=...'
```

**Poor cURL (missing authentication):**
```bash
curl 'https://music.youtube.com/static/...' \
  -H 'Accept: text/css'
```

## Fallback Mode

If authentication isn't working:

1. **Use manual playlist IDs**: You can still access public playlists
2. **Public mode**: The app continues to work normally
3. **No loss of functionality**: All core features remain available
