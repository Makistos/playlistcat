# GitHub Releases Guide ðŸš€

This document explains how to create releases for PlaylistCat with cross-platform artifacts.

## Overview

PlaylistCat uses GitHub Actions to automatically build executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux, then creates releases with all platform artifacts.

## Release Methods

### 1. Automatic Release (Recommended)

Releases are automatically created when you push a version tag:

```bash
# Create and push a version tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This triggers the `release.yml` workflow which:
- Builds executables for all platforms
- Runs basic tests on each platform
- Creates a GitHub release with all artifacts
- Generates release notes automatically

### 2. Manual Release

You can also trigger releases manually via GitHub Actions:

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select **Manual Release** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Enter version (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
5. Choose release options (draft/prerelease)
6. Click **Run workflow**

## Release Artifacts

Each release includes the following artifacts:

### Windows (`playlistcat-windows-x64.zip`)
- `playlistcat.exe` - GUI application
- `playlistcat-cli.exe` - CLI application
- `run-gui.bat` - GUI launcher script
- `run-cli.bat` - CLI launcher script
- Documentation and examples

### macOS (`playlistcat-macos-x64.tar.gz`)
- `playlistcat` - GUI application
- `playlistcat-cli` - CLI application
- `run-gui.sh` - GUI launcher script
- `run-cli.sh` - CLI launcher script
- Documentation and examples

### Linux (`playlistcat-linux-x64.tar.gz`)
- `playlistcat` - GUI application
- `playlistcat-cli` - CLI application
- `run-gui.sh` - GUI launcher script
- `run-cli.sh` - CLI launcher script
- Documentation and examples

## Version Numbering

Use semantic versioning (SemVer):
- `v1.0.0` - Major release
- `v1.1.0` - Minor release (new features)
- `v1.0.1` - Patch release (bug fixes)

## Pre-release Process

For testing releases:

1. Create a pre-release tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0-beta.1
   git push origin v1.0.0-beta.1
   ```

2. Or use manual release with "pre-release" checked

Pre-releases are marked as "Pre-release" on GitHub and won't notify users.

## Draft Releases

Create draft releases for internal review:

1. Use manual release workflow
2. Check "Create as draft"
3. Review the draft release
4. Publish when ready

## Release Notes

Release notes are automatically generated with:
- Version information
- Download links for each platform
- Installation instructions
- Feature highlights

You can edit release notes after creation if needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

If builds fail:

1. Check the Actions tab for error logs
2. Common issues:
   - Missing dependencies in `requirements.txt`
   - Import errors (check `src/` imports)
   - Platform-specific build issues

### Missing Artifacts

If artifacts are missing from releases:

1. Verify the build completed successfully
2. Check artifact upload step in workflow logs
3. Ensure file paths in workflow match actual build outputs

### Testing Releases

Before major releases:

1. Download artifacts from a test release
2. Test on each target platform
3. Verify all features work correctly
4. Check executable sizes are reasonable

## Manual Testing Checklist

Before releasing:

- [ ] GUI application starts without errors
- [ ] CLI application works with test commands
- [ ] Playlist fetching works with valid URL/ID
- [ ] Table sorting functions correctly
- [ ] All launcher scripts work
- [ ] Documentation is up to date
- [ ] No console errors in GUI mode

## Release Promotion

After creating a release:

1. Update README.md with latest version info
2. Announce on relevant channels/forums
3. Update package managers if applicable
4. Monitor for user feedback and issues

## Security Considerations

- Releases are built in GitHub's secure runners
- All dependencies are installed fresh for each build
- No secrets or API keys are included in artifacts
- Users should verify checksums for critical deployments

## Continuous Integration

The release workflow includes:
- Multi-platform builds
- Basic smoke tests
- Artifact validation
- Automated release creation

This ensures consistent, reliable releases across all supported platforms.
